Missionaries and Cannibals Game 🚣‍♂️🌊
This is a Python-based game where you must safely transport three missionaries and three cannibals across the river without breaking the rules!

📜 Rules
The boat can carry 1 or 2 people at a time.

You cannot leave more cannibals than missionaries on either side, or the missionaries will be eaten! 🍽️

Move all six characters safely across to win! 🎉

🖥️ How to Play?
Click on the characters to put them on the boat (Max 2 at a time).

Click "Move Boat" to cross the river.

Follow the rules to ensure everyone reaches the other side safely.
